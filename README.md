# dummyIntegrationServer
Simple Node server for listening to http requests intended to be sent to third party systems... Logs info to console for each request. The EntityBody is assumed to be JSON.

This was created for a specific purpose. As-is it is probably not very helpful to anyone else. I am open to suggestions or pull requests. But to be honest there is not a whole lot of work here... I just didn't want to set it up from scratch again when I need it later on.
